# Project Description Outline

Andrew and I will be starting with a semi-arbitrarily large dataset of points in R^n and
will be constructing a mesh of triangles from this mesh while identifying holes in the mesh.

We will then do further analysis of our data using the mesh based on Matthew's guidance. Further
description will come in the future when Matthew gives us more information.

For now we will be constructing our mesh and finding holes.
